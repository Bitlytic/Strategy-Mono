# What is this?

## GDScript Version
There is a GDScript and C# version available.

This is the GDScript version, you can find the C# version [here]().

### Template Project
This is a top down arena shooter that uses Composition and the Strategy Pattern. It is designed in such a way that you can clone this github repo and use it as a template with a few things ready to go. The assets in this project have also been chosen so that you can use them for quick prototyping and if you decide to go commercial, there is no licensing other than giving credit due.


### GDScript & C#
This project is full of comments, the C# version has nearly the same comments. If you are interested in learning C# and you know GDScript or vice-versa, doing a search for the text inside of comments is a great way to see how something in one language is done in the other.

### Strategy Pattern
This is a project that uses the Strategy Pattern for my tutorial on [YouTube](www.youtube.com/bitlytic) made in Godot 4.2


### Using this Project

Using this project should be as simple as cloning it via git or downloading as a zip file. From there, you can point Godot to the project.godot file, and it _should_ just run.

I do not require credit, you can use this as a template or a learning resource or any way you want to. If you do, you're welcome to share it and tag me on Twitter [@Bitlytic](www.twitter.com/bitlytic), I would love to see what you make!
